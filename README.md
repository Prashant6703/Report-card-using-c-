# Student Record Management System in C++

This project implements a student record management system using C++. It allows users to perform operations such as adding, displaying, modifying, and deleting student records. The records are stored persistently in a binary file (`student.dat`).

## Features

- **Add Student Record:** Enter details such as roll number, name, and marks in various subjects (Physics, Chemistry, Maths, English, Computer Science).
- **Display All Records:** View all student records stored in the file.
- **Search Student Record:** Find and display details of a specific student by roll number.
- **Modify Student Record:** Update details of a student by roll number.
- **Delete Student Record:** Remove a student record from the file.
- **Result and Report:** Calculate and display overall class results and detailed report cards for individual students.

## Compile:
Compile the main.cpp file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++ on Linux, MinGW on Windows).

g++ main.cpp -o student_records

## Run:
Execute the compiled program.

./student_records

## Navigate through Menu:

Use numeric options to perform operations such as adding records, displaying all records, searching, modifying, deleting, viewing class results, and student report cards.


## File Structure

main.cpp: Contains the main program logic and function definitions for student operations.
student.dat: Binary file used to store student records persistently.
